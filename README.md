# Library-Management-System-with-C_plus_plus-and-SQLite

It is a codeblocks console project. No GUI applied. SQLite is used to store all kinds of data. So, no additional software is needed to run(only codeblocks).

The project will show splash screen. Then, if the project is run for the first time, it will need an admin, so the project will require username and password for admin. There can only be one admin, only one admin can access to the projects hidden features to anyone but admin.

In this project, you can see all the books available or search for a perticular book. You can also see details of a particular book. You can issue a book only when you see the details of the book. So, you cannot issue multiple books alltogether. Only admin can modify any information of a book and delete that book if he/she wants when admin sees details of that book. An admin does not issue book. So, admin will not be able to see any option for issuing a book.

Again, all kinds of issuing book or adding more books records are going to be stored. Only admin can see that. Admin can also see list of all the members who has account and search for a member. 

Option for go to own profile has not been added yet.
